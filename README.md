# Code Typer

Stop googling for that switch statement. Let your muscle memory type it for you, while you focus on the real problem.

1. Create a gist with the snippet of code you want to practice, for example: https://gist.github.com/MauricioRobayo/d6bf88f90a8d0b28e0847f3ac32df11b
2. On the gist url, replace `gist.github.com` with `codetyper.io`: https://codetyper.io/MauricioRobayo/d6bf88f90a8d0b28e0847f3ac32df11b
3. Practice

To get all your gist and start typing, go to `https://codetyper.io/<username>`.

Alternatively, you can use any url as the source as long as it returned `content-type` is `text/pain`, just pass the url or any raw text to the `raw` query param, for example:

https://codetyper.io/?raw=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/master/src/algorithms/sorting/bubble-sort/BubbleSort.js
